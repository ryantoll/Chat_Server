This program is the server side of an instant messenger application.
It is designed to be paired with the corresponding server application on a private network.
The pair is a portfolio piece meant to demonstrate competence with C++ and the Windows API.
Thus far I have verified it works on a single computer with a single user.
I have not yet verified it with multiple users at different ip addresses.

Other topics:
Socket communication with BSD/Winsocket
Multithreading
UI/UX
Class design & encapsulation

AppWizard has created this Chat_Server application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Chat_Server application.


Chat_Server.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Chat_Server.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

Chat_Server.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named Chat_Server.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
